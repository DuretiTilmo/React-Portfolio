            <p>
            I am a boot camp graduate with Full Stack Web Development. As a young woman new to tech, I am confident that I now have a solid understanding of coding and web development. Even though I have zero experience with IT, I am very committed to web development. Before I joined boot camp I dedicated myself for months to teaching myself how to write code on my own from scratch and built a web page through LinkedIn learning and being consistent with my practices. And now, I am very eager to apply my knowledge to software developmentÂ that meets the needs of my clients, which makes me an excellent addition to any organization seeking to hire a junior developer.
